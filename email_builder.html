            Dear Hiring Manager
            
            I hope this email finds you well. My name is Angel Macwan, and I am writing to express my strong interest in the ${position} position.
            
            As a Data Scientist with a Master's in Data Science from Amity University and a Bachelor's in Computer Application and Information Technology from Sardar Patel University, I bring a diverse skill set that includes expertise in Python, R, Java, JavaScript, Spark, Hadoop, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. Currently employed as a Systems Engineer/Big Data Engineer at IBM India, I have hands-on experience in working with big data systems for management and analysis using AWS, Azure, Hadoop, Spark, and DataBricks.
            
            During my time at IBM, I have excelled in research-driven projects, particularly in Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and AI Automation. My proficiency in programming, coupled with my problem-solving skills and real-world corporate experience, positions me as a valuable candidate in the field of data science.
            
            In my previous role as a Data Science Intern at Mindworks Group, I developed an innovative visualization library that significantly reduced the time required for animated visualizations. My experience extends to software analysis at Tata Consultancy Services, where I designed and maintained APIs, tested microservices, and worked with technologies such as React, Node, Python, and Java.
            
            I am confident that my skills and experiences align well with the requirements of the ${position} role, and I am eager to contribute my expertise to your dynamic team.
            
            Enclosed is my resume, which provides further details about my educational background, professional experience, and certifications, including the Databricks Certified Associate Developer for Apache Spark 3.0.
            
            Thank you for considering my application.
            I am available at your earliest convenience for an interview and can be reached via email at armacwan@gmail.com or by phone at (+91) 7405448639.
            
            I look forward to a positive responce.
            
            Sincerely,
